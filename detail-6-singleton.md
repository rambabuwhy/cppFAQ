## Singleton

In C++, a singleton is a design pattern that ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to that instance. It is useful when exactly one object is needed to coordinate actions across the system.

Here's an example of a simple singleton implementation in C++:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

class Singleton {
private:
    // Private constructor to prevent instantiation
    Singleton() {}

    // Private copy constructor and assignment operator to prevent cloning
    Singleton(const Singleton&);
    Singleton& operator=(const Singleton&);

    // Private static instance of the singleton
    static Singleton* instance;

public:
    // Public method to access the singleton instance
    static Singleton* getInstance() {
        if (!instance) {
            instance = new Singleton();
        }
        return instance;
    }

    // Public method to perform some action
    void performAction() {
        std::cout << "Singleton is performing an action." << std::endl;
    }
};

// Initialize the static instance to nullptr
Singleton* Singleton::instance = nullptr;

int main() {
    // Access the singleton instance
    Singleton* singletonInstance1 = Singleton::getInstance();
    singletonInstance1->performAction();

    // Attempt to create another instance
    // Singleton* singletonInstance2 = new Singleton(); // Error: Singleton constructor is private

    return 0;
}
```

In this example:

* The `Singleton` class has a private constructor, copy constructor, and assignment operator to prevent direct instantiation and cloning.
* The `getInstance()` method is used to get the singleton instance. If the instance doesn't exist, it creates one. The instance is stored as a static member variable.
* The `performAction()` method is an example of some functionality that the singleton class may provide.
* In the `main` function, we demonstrate how to access the singleton instance and perform an action. Note that attempting to create another instance using `new Singleton()` will result in a compilation error due to the private constructor.

It's important to note that while the singleton pattern can be useful in certain situations, its usage should be carefully considered, as it can introduce global state and make code less modular.

## Thread-safe

The example provided is not thread-safe. If multiple threads attempt to access the `getInstance()` method concurrently, it can lead to a race condition where more than one instance of the singleton may be created.

To make the singleton implementation thread-safe, you can use various mechanisms, such as locks or the double-checked locking pattern. Here's an example using the double-checked locking pattern with a mutex:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <mutex>

class Singleton {
private:
    Singleton() {}

    Singleton(const Singleton&);
    Singleton& operator=(const Singleton&);

    static Singleton* instance;
    static std::mutex mutex;

public:
    static Singleton* getInstance() {
        // Check if an instance exists without locking (double-checked locking)
        if (!instance) {
            std::lock_guard<std::mutex> lock(mutex);
            // Check again inside the lock to avoid race condition
            if (!instance) {
                instance = new Singleton();
            }
        }
        return instance;
    }

    void performAction() {
        std::cout << "Singleton is performing an action." << std::endl;
    }
};

Singleton* Singleton::instance = nullptr;
std::mutex Singleton::mutex;

int main() {
    // Access the singleton instance
    Singleton* singletonInstance1 = Singleton::getInstance();
    singletonInstance1->performAction();

    return 0;
}
```

In this modified example:

* A `std::mutex` is used to synchronize access to the `getInstance()` method.
* The `std::lock_guard` is employed to automatically lock and unlock the mutex in a scoped manner.
* The double-checked locking pattern is used to minimize the performance impact of the lock, ensuring that the lock is only acquired when necessary.

This makes the singleton implementation thread-safe, and it can be safely used in a multi-threaded environment. Keep in mind that using locks may introduce some performance overhead, so it's essential to evaluate the trade-offs based on the specific requirements of your application.
