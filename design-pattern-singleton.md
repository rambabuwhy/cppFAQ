# Design Pattern-Singleton

The Singleton design pattern is a creational pattern that ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to that instance.

Let's go through the implementation step by step:

1.  **Singleton Class Definition:**

    ```cpp
    class Singleton {
    public:
        // ...
    private:
        // ...
    };
    ```

    Define the `Singleton` class. This class will have only one instance, and we'll control access to that instance through a static method.
2.  **Public Static Method - `getInstance()`:**

    ```cpp
    public:
        static Singleton& getInstance() {
            // ...
        }
    ```

    Declare a public static method called `getInstance()`. This method will be responsible for providing access to the single instance of the class. It returns a reference to the instance.
3.  **Static Local Variable in `getInstance()`:**

    ```cpp
    static Singleton instance;
    ```

    Inside the `getInstance()` method, declare a static local variable of type `Singleton`. This variable will be initialized the first time the `getInstance()` method is called.
4.  **Private Constructor and Destructor:**

    ```cpp
    private:
        Singleton() {
            // Constructor code goes here
        }

        ~Singleton() {
            // Destructor code goes here
        }
    ```

    Declare a private constructor to prevent external instantiation of the class. Also, declare a private destructor to control the destruction of the instance.
5.  **Deleted Copy Constructor and Assignment Operator:**

    ```cpp
    Singleton(const Singleton&) = delete;
    Singleton& operator=(const Singleton&) = delete;
    ```

    Declare the copy constructor and assignment operator as deleted to prevent copying of the instance. This ensures that there is only one instance of the class.
6.  **Other Member Functions and Variables:**

    ```cpp
    // Other public and private member functions and variables can be added here
    ```

    You can add other member functions and variables as needed for the functionality of your Singleton class.
7.  **Example Usage in `main()`:**

    ```cpp
    int main() {
        Singleton& instance = Singleton::getInstance();
        // Use the instance as needed
        return 0;
    }
    ```

    In the `main()` function (or any other part of your program), you can obtain the instance of the `Singleton` class using the `getInstance()` method.

This implementation ensures that there is only one instance of the `Singleton` class, and it provides a global point of access to that instance. Remember that this basic implementation is not thread-safe, so additional measures might be needed in a multi-threaded environment.
